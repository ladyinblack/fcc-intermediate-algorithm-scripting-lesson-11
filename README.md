## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
You have to create a program that will convert HTML entities from string to their corresponding HTML entities.  There are only a few so you can use different methods.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
You can use regular expressions.

### Hint 2
You will benefit from a chart with all the html entities so you know which ones are the right ones to put.

### Hint 3
You should separate the string and work with each character to convert the right ones and then join everything back up.
